# 📝 Feedback for Round 1-IDEA SUBMISSION

- The combination of LSTM and Reinforcement Learning sounds nice and the fact that you are utilizing actual financial features is nice.  
- Using data of the last 10 minutes would mean that you would have to use pre-trained models and fine-tune them for your use case.  
- You would need high computing resources so ideally something like colab pro might be required.  
- Analysis on real time is quite challenging to implement.  
- More details on how market sentiment will be implemented in the project.  
- Use the right dataset, a good historical dataset with small intervals would be useful for RL.

# ⚠️ Challenges & Project Report

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

1. **Data Access Limitations**
   - Reliable and accurate stock data APIs require **paid subscriptions (≥ $49)**.
   - Real-time data feeds also require subscriptions, increasing the project's cost for individual/student use.

2. **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**
   - Incorporating real-time **market sentiment** is challenging due to:
     - Abundance of **fake or misleading news**
     - Difficulty in filtering trustworthy sources

3. **Pre-Trained Model Availability**
   - Most advanced models in this space are:
     - **Not open-source**
     - Available **only via paid services**

## 🔍 Review & Recommendations

# 🧪 Project Review Summary

- Assemble everything properly in a Github repository as mentioned.  
- Incorporate the RL model you proposed and quantitatively show the benefit.  
- Show proof of concept on previous normal day data, mention error rate of your predictions and implement the paid API only if you have spare time.
